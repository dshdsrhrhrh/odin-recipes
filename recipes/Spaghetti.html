    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Season
            spaghetti squash with salt and pepper and place cut side down on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and cool
            until easily handled. Scrape insides of squash into spaghetti strands with a fork.</li>
        <li>Heat 4 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook garlic until fragrant, about
            2 minutes. Add shrimp and season with salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Saute shrimp until pink,
            tossing often to prevent burning, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add spaghetti squash strands. Mix in
            lemon juice and zest. Serve sprinkled with parsley.</li>
